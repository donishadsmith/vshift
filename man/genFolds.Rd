\title{Create Split Datasets and/or Folds with Optional Stratification}
\usage{
genFolds(
  data,
  target,
  train_params = list(split = NULL, n_folds = NULL, stratified = FALSE, random_seed =
    NULL),
  create_data = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{target}{A numeric or character value specifying the target variable. Only required if\code{stratified = TRUE}.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{train_params}{A list that can contain the following parameters:
\itemize{
 \item \code{split}: A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion of data to use
 for training. The remaining observations are allocated to the test set. If not specified or set to \code{NULL}, no
 train-test splitting is performed. Note that this split is separate from cross-validation. Default is \code{NULL}.
 \item \code{n_folds}: An integer greater than 2 specifying the number of folds for cross-validation. If \code{NULL},
 no cross-validation is performed. Default is \code{NULL}.
 \item \code{stratified}: A logical value indicating whether stratified sampling should be used during splitting.
 Default is \code{FALSE}.
 \item \code{random_seed}: A numeric value for the random seed to ensure reproducibility of random splitting and any
 model training that relies on random starts. Default is \code{NULL}.
 }}

\item{create_data}{A logical value indicating whether to create all training and test/validation data frames.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the indices for train-test splitting and/or cross-validation, with information on class
distribution in the training, test sets, and folds (if applicable). It also includes the generated split datasets
and folds based on those indices.
}
\description{
A standalone function to generate train-test split datasets and/or cross-validation folds, optionally
performing stratified sampling based on class distribution.
}
\examples{
# Load example dataset

data(iris)

# Obtain indices for 80\% training/test split and 5-fold CV

output <- genFolds(data = iris, target = "Species", train_params = list(split = 0.8, n_folds = 5))
